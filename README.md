# Project Description
We are working on a website to build a puzzle game using quantum circuits, quantum gates, quantum hardware theoritical knowledge to make human learn quantum computing.Player is given access to IBM Quantum simulators to solve the puzzle questions as they reach to the hard and moderate level of the game. Till now, we have been able to make a prototype version of the game.
# Hack Solution
To solve our hack problem of making an interactive “program”, we have to build a game website where a user has to solve puzzles to win the game. First, we have sign-in and sign-up options so that players can have their data secured in the google account with which they have signed in. Then, they are given three levels of the game, Beginner, Moderate and Hard levels. In the first level of Beginner, the user will have to solve a puzzle having the utmost of 10 pieces and each piece will have simple questions related to quantum circuits, quantum gates and some theoretical quantum hardware-related questions which have been created from the qiskit notebook. For the moderate level, the user is then asked to solve more challenging puzzles having more pieces like 15-25 and more difficult questions about quantum computing, coding, and building big quantum circuits using IBM Quantum Simulators will be used to make the moderate level of the game. After these two levels, we have our final Hard level, for which we can level up the questions to face off human vs quantum computer by using quantum machine learning and advanced qiskit material to solve puzzle pieces which will be in the range of 50 to 100 pieces puzzle problem.
